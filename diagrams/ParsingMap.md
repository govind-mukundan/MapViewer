# A MAP file viewer with a bit of help from the Elf and the Dwarf

When you're writing firmware, there always comes a time when you need to check the resources consumed by your efforts - perhaps because you're running out of RAM or Flash or you want to optimize something. The map file generated by your linker is a useful tool to aid in the resource analysis. I wanted to filter and sort the data generated in an interactive way so I wrote a C# WinForms application that reads the data from the map and presents it in a list view (using the awesome  [ObjectListView](http://objectlistview.sourceforge.net/cs/index.html) control. In addition to a "module" or file based split of resources consumed it also shows you some **information not present** in the map file like all the Global and Static symbols (both functions and variables) used in the project. A screen-shot of the application is shown below.

The code can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/govind-mukundan/MapViewer)

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/39115584/WebsiteDownloads/mv_scshot.png)

The application was developed while I was writing firmware for the [FT900](http://www.ftdichip.com/MCU.html) micro-controller which is a new 32 bit micro-controller by FTDI . However since the FT32 toolchain is based on GCC, the application code can be easily configured/updated to work with other GCC + BINUTILS based toolchains (I have tried it on Microchip's XC16 toolchain).

In this post I will first talk about the data that's exposed (and not exposed) in a map file followed by a description of the program itself. 

## The memory map of a basic program
A simple embedded system typically has the memory map shown below (ignoring peripheral memory). At the highest level the program can be divided into components - the code and the data it manipulates. The code in an embedded system goes into the flash the the data goes into the RAM if it's mutable and flash or RAM if it's read-only. The data used by a program can be split into statically allocated global data regions - the initialized DATA segment and the zero-initialised BSS segment and the runtime allocated memory - the Stack and the Heap.

This is the what the memory looks like when we are executing a program. However there was a time in space before the big bang when the program was living entirely on the flash and the RAM was just a jumble of random bits. How did it come to be that when the program was running the global data that the program access happen to have the right values and the memory map looks nice and orderly as above? The answer is that the program executable contains bootstrap code that initializes the RAM to the program correct memory map before any of the code that refers the data executes. In embedded systems this boot code is called the ctr0 (the C runtime zero).

What this means is that the initial values of all the data that a program uses must itself be stored in the program executable file, otherwise there is no way that the RAM can be initialized by the crt0. Usually this data is stored after all the code in the program. The typical map of a bin/hex file is shown below

	   ,'''''''''''''''''''''|FILE_START

	   | \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ |

	   |':OF VARIABLES:IN   '|
	   |.:DATA SEGMENT:.    .|
	   L_____________________|FILE_END


As a consequence, when you declare a global variable initialized to some non-zero value, you not only consume RAM but also Flash! 

Luckily, back in the day [when men didn't shave their chests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcF3hvoRyck) someone figured out that most of the globals are usually initialized to zero, and we could save some flash space if we put all of these zero-initialized globals in a separate block of RAM, and just specify the start address + length of this section. Thus the BSS was born and claims all those globals left uninitialized by lazy programmers along with those specifically initialized to zero.

The details of this memory map used during execution and while building the executable is specified in the **linker script** file. The FT32 linker script file looks like this:

	MEMORY
	{
	  flash     (rx)   : ORIGIN = 0, LENGTH = 150K
	  ram       (rw!x) : ORIGIN = 0x800000, LENGTH = 32K
	}
	SECTIONS
	{
	
	  .text :
	  {
	    ./crt0.o(.text*)
	    *(.text*)
	    *(.strings)
	    *(._pm*)
	    *(.init)
	    *(.fini)
	     _etext = . ;
	    . = ALIGN(4);
	  }  > flash
	
	  .data	  : AT (ADDR (.text) + SIZEOF (.text))
	  {
	  	. = ALIGN(4);
	    __data = .;
	    *(.data)
	     *(.data*)
	     *(.rodata)
	    *(.rodata*)
	     _edata = . ;
	  }  > ram
	  . = ALIGN(4);
	  .bss  SIZEOF(.data) + ADDR(.data) :
	  {
	     _bss_start = . ;
	    *(.bss)
	    *(COMMON)
	     _end = . ;
	  }  > ram
	  
	   __data_load_start = LOADADDR(.data);
	   __data_load_end = __data_load_start + SIZEOF(.data);

This file is input to the linker, and allows the linker to map the text/data/bss regions in every object file into real physical addresses and also influences the merging of all the sections together into the final executable file. Refer the LD documentation for more information on the [syntax of the script](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/ld/Scripts.html). For our intents we can note that the sections named *.text, *.strings etc go into the .text segment in the flash and *.data, *rodata, *bss etc go into the ram. The .data segment is itself stored after the end of the .text segment using the **AT()** directive.

To see the linker script being used in a build, use the **--verbose** option with LD.

## Interpreting a Map File
A map file can be generated by passing the **--print-map > MyMapFile.txt** string to LD. In addition the **--cref** option will print the cross-reference table which is very useful when you want to track down references to symbols. Scrolling down the map file you'll encounter a section named **Linker script and memory map**. This contains a breakdown of the memory contribution of each and every file that was linked into the final image.

To illustrate the analysis I have created a simple project of two files. All the explanations will be based on this simple project. Compiling this project with the following 

	'Building file: ../main.c'
	'Invoking: FT90x GCC Compiler'
	ft32-elf-gcc -I"C:/Program Files (x86)/FTDI/FT90x Toolchain/Toolchain/hardware/include" -O0 -g -fvar-tracking -fvar-tracking-assignments -Wall -c -fmessage-length=0 -ffunction-sections -MMD -MP -MF"main.d" -MT"main.d" -o "main.o" "../main.c"
	'Finished building: ../main.c'
	' '
	'Building file: ../test.c'
	'Invoking: FT90x GCC Compiler'
	ft32-elf-gcc -I"C:/Program Files (x86)/FTDI/FT90x Toolchain/Toolchain/hardware/include" -O0 -g -fvar-tracking -fvar-tracking-assignments -Wall -c -fmessage-length=0 -ffunction-sections -MMD -MP -MF"test.d" -MT"test.d" -o "test.o" "../test.c"
	'Finished building: ../test.c'
	' '
	'Building target: MapParser.elf'
	'Invoking: FT90x GCC Linker'
	ft32-elf-gcc -L"C:/Program Files (x86)/FTDI/FT90x Toolchain/Toolchain/hardware/lib" -Wl,--gc-sections -Wl,--entry=_start -Wl,--print-map > Linker.map -Xlinker --cref -Xlinker --verbose -o "MapParser.elf"  ./main.o ./test.o   -lc -lstub -lft900
	'Finished building target: MapParser.elf'

The text region of the example project looks like this:

	.text           0x00000000     0xf080
	 *(.text*)
	 .text          0x00000000      0x310 /cygdrive/c/Program Files (x86)/FTDI/FT90x Toolchain/Toolchain/tools/bin/../lib/gcc/ft32-elf/5.0.0/crti-hw.o
	                0x00000000                _start
	                0x00000090                _exithook
	                0x000000fc                _exit
	                0x0000030c                nullvector
	                0x00000310                __gxx_personality_sj0
	 .text.StaticFunc
	                0x00000310       0x20 ./main.o
	 .text.GlobalFunc
	                0x00000330       0x20 ./main.o
	                0x00000330                GlobalFunc
	 .text.main     0x00000350       0x44 ./main.o
	                0x00000350                main
	 .text.StaticFunc
	                0x00000394       0x38 ./test.o
	 .text.Test     0x000003cc       0x14 ./test.o
	                0x000003cc                Test
	                ....
                
 We can see that the .text segment starts at address 0x00000000 and has a size of 0xF080 bytes. The first module in the .text segment is a file called ctri-hw.o of size 0x310 bytes and there are 4 global functions defined in this file. The *--ffunction-sections* option has ensured that each function is compiled in a separate section, which allows the linker (via *-Wl,--gc-sections*) to later remove any functions that are not called from the final executable. 
 
Similar map information is available for the .data and .bss segments. However **static symbols in the data and bss segments are missing**!

Getting the module wise breakdown of memory is a simple matter of reading the lines corresponding to the **.o** files and extracting the size. 

## The Cross Reference Table
The cross reference table appears below the memory map and shows you a list of all the global symbols in the project. The first line indicates the file in which the symbol is defined and following lines indicate all the locations that the symbol is used. This is extremely useful to track down "rogue modules" that use stuff they shouldn't be using.

	Cross Reference Table
	
	Symbol                                   File
	BSSGlobal                                ./main.o
	DataGlobal                               ./main.o
	GlobalFunc                               ./main.o     ----> The above 3 symbols are not accessed outside main.o
	Test                                     ./test.o     ----> The symbol "Test" is defined in test.o
	                                         ./main.o     ----> The symbol "Test" is referenced in main.o
                                             
## Hunting down `statics` with Some ELF Magic

The absence of static symbols in the map file is annoying for the conscientious programmer who has used static variables and functions liberally to aid in the principles of data encapsulation and also to allow the compiler to optimize better. In fact if we had not used the *--ffunction-sections* option static functions would also have been missing from the map.  Fortunately there are some ways around this limitation.

For most embedded systems the final output of the build process is a BIN or HEX file that can be programmed into the microcontroller flash. However before we get to the HEX file, the linker actually produces another executable file from which we extract the .text segment to get the hex file. There are many formats for this executable file, COFF and ELF being the most common. We will consider ELF as it's the more flexible format. Typically many embedded toolchains generate both the ELF and the HEX file in the same output directory.

Assuming you have managed to get hold of the ELF executable for your project, we can try to get more some information from it by using [BINUTILS](https://sourceware.org/binutils/) programs, which are hopefully part of your toolchain distribution. In addition to containing all the segments of a program (as defined in the linker script), the ELF image also contains a **Symbol Table** which lists all the global (static and non-static) symbols in the executable. Using [READELF](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/binutils/readelf.html#readelf) to readout the symbol table of our project results in this output

<!--language: lang-none -->

	$ C:\Program Files (x86)\FTDI\FT90x Toolchain\Toolchain\tools\bin> .\ft32-elf-readelf.exe -s "MapParserTest_FT32\Debug\MapParser.elf"
		
	Symbol table '.symtab' contains 342 entries:
	Num:    Value  Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx Name
	 0: 00000000     0 NOTYPE  LOCAL  DEFAULT  UND 
	 1: 00000000     0 SECTION LOCAL  DEFAULT    1 
	 2: 00800000     0 SECTION LOCAL  DEFAULT    2 
	 3: 00800000     0 SECTION LOCAL  DEFAULT    3 
	....
	142: 00800a48    40 OBJECT  GLOBAL DEFAULT    3 __mprec_tinytens
	143: 0000a0b4    84 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT    1 _lseek_r
	144: 0000d31c   204 FUNC    GLOBAL HIDDEN     1 __eqdf2
	145: 0000030c     0 NOTYPE  GLOBAL DEFAULT    1 nullvector
	146: 0000ba94     0 NOTYPE  GLOBAL HIDDEN     1 __prolog_$r28
	147: 0000b828     0 NOTYPE  GLOBAL HIDDEN     1 __epilog24_$r19
	148: 00000410    60 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT    1 printf
	...
   

Now we can see all the static symbols too along with their addresses. But we still don't have an easy way to see their size and source file name. Turns out BINUTILS has a program called [NM](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/binutils/nm.html) that is written for precisely this purpose! Running NM with options to sort by size and indicate line numbers produces this output.

	$ C:\Program Files (x86)\FTDI\FT90x Toolchain\Toolchain\tools\bin> .\ft32-elf-nm.exe --print-size --size-sort --line-numbers "MapParserTest_FT32\Debug\MapParser.elf"

Now we have the sizes of all the symbols and the source files of many of them. NM hasn't listed the line numbers for static variables again unfortunately. Thus our journey continues into the land of the dwarves.

## Meet the DWARF

Anyone who has used a debugger knows that the debugger is not blind to static variables and is able to identify the files in which they were born. Thus all we have to do is look into the information that the debugger uses to solve our problem. Dwarf is a common debugging information standard that everyone uses. The DWARF debug information is itself stored inside the ELF file in separate "debug" sections. We can extract the debug information using [OBJDUMP](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs-2.19/binutils/objdump.html) or READELF. (The tool uses readelf as xc16 objdump seems to be unable to extract debug info)

Dwarf organizes information in terms of **Compilation Units** which is another way of saying files. Each compilation unit has a tree of information associated with it which includes all the functions and variables (among a lot of other things) defined in that file. Extracting the *dwarf_info* segment gives us:

	$ .\ft32-elf-objdump.exe --dwarf=info path_to_elf > path_to_op_file

	    <185>   DW_AT_location    : 5 byte block: 3 20 d 0 0 	(DW_OP_addr: d20)
	.....

The first element in the tree identified with the tag *<0>* is the compilation unit which happens to be **main.c**. Subsequent elements related to main.c are identified by tags grater than 0.
Observe that functions are identified with the tag `DW_TAG_subprogram`. `DW_AT_low_pc` indicates the **start address** of the function, this is the same as what's indicated by the NM output start address. `DW_AT_high_pc` indicates the **size in bytes** of the function. Similarly variables are identified by the tag `DW_TAG_variable` and `DW_OP_addr` indicates the start address in RAM of the variable. 

Thus given that we have the symbol list from NM, we just have to find the compilation unit corresponding to each of the symbols at a particular address. The combination of Symbol Name and (runtime) Address uniquely locates all global functions and variables even if they are declared static and have multiple definitions across different files. 

Note that to generate the maximum debug information, you should use the **-g3** LD option. The extra debug information only goes into the ELF file and not the binary/HEX file so normally there shouldn't be any penalty in terms of microcontroller resources by adding the -g3 option into the build.

## Implementation details
Now that I've explained how the data can be obtained, I will briefly cover the details of the MapParser software so that the reader can modify the code to suit his or her target. 

### User Interface
The UI is mainly made up of two list views - one listing the file/module wise split of the executable and another listing all the symbols in the project. Filters can be used to see the contribution of a subset of files and/or symbols. Filtering a group of files automatically filters the symbols in the group. . 

The settings view is used to set the paths to the map/elf file, and the BINUTILS paths for NM and OBJDUMP. The mapping of input sections to the default output sections of TEXT, DATA and BSS is also specified.

### Module View
The module view shows the contribution of each object file to the TEXT, DATA and BSS sections defined in the linker script. The information is gathered by parsing the "Memory Map" section in the map file. Example lines of interest are:

	 .text._write   0x0000aca0       0x34 /cygdrive/c/Program Files (x86)/FTDI/FT90x Toolchain/Toolchain/tools/bin/../lib/gcc/ft32-elf/5.0.0/../../../../ft32-elf/lib/libstub.a(stdio.o)
					0x0000aca0                _write
	 .data          0x00800084       0x10 ./main.o
					0x00800084                DataGlobal
	 .data          0x00800094        0x8 ./test.o
	 
	  *(.bss)
	 .bss           0x00800ce4        0x4 ./main.o
	 .bss           0x00800ce8        0x4 ./test.o

#### Linker Optimizations on strings
You might notice that the actual size of the data segment is **less than** what's obtained by summing the data contributions of each module. This appears to be because the linker does some optimizations to merge common string literals across modules within the **rodata** sections. String literals within a file are stored in the **rodata.str1.4** section by GCC and are marked for linker optimization. The size before optimization is indicated in the MAP file by *(size before relaxing)*

### Symbol View
To get the symbols, we run NM on the ELF file and extract the symbols sorted by size. The *SEC* column indicates which section the symbol goes into (Text = T, Data = D and BSS = B).  The *Global* column identifies Global Symbols (G), Static Symbols (S) and "Hidden" symbols (H). I define "Hidden" symbols as those symbols that are visible in the Map file but are absent in the NM output; this is not the "proper" classification as if you look at the ELF symbol table there are a lot of other symbols marked as *Hidden*. Finding the size of these hidden symbols is a bit tricky; for now I find the size by subtracting the sizes of the symbols addresses in the Map file while assuming that the total size of all the symbols is equal to the module size. This algorithm will give incorrect results if the module contains non-hidden symbols. I could possibly find the correct size by looking at information from the ELF symbol table; but that's way deep into the valley of diminishing returns and not really worth perusing for now.  

The symbols shown in the symbol view will be filtered according to the files selected in the module view. To *reset* the symbol view to show all symbols, click the *reset syms* button. Rows in the symbol view can be filtered just as the module view.

### Actuals
As both the sum of modules and symbols need not always add up to the actual resources consumed, there's a third display that shows the **actual** size reported in the Map file. This is calculated by summing the contents of the total "segment size" in the Map file. i.e. lines such as these

	.data           0x00800000      0xce4 load address 0x0000f080
	.text           0x00000000     0xf080

###Observations
Looking at the symbol output for the test project, you can see that the names of static variables with function scope (`static unsigned int FuncScopeStatic`) have been mangled with a **.NNNN** suffix. This is how GCC handles more than one (static) variable with the same name within a file. Static variables/functions with the same name but defined in different files do not need to be mangled, as the compiler only sees one file at a time.

Simply adding up the sizes of all the symbols will not normally equal the size of the modules or the *actual* size of the various sections. One of the reasons is the presence of string literals that have no associated symbol name (eg: `printf("I'm a nameless string");`). There are also padding bytes marked as **\*fill\*** in the Map file, which are not counted by the tool as of now.

## Porting To a new target
When porting the tool to a new target, the first thing that needs to be done is to tell the tool which sections map to the Text/Data/Bss segments. This mapping is configured in the tool **Settings**, and the information should be available in the target linker script. I have already configured it for FT32, XC16 and XC32. If your target has more segments than the default Text/Data/Bss, you would need to add new columns into the ObjectListView and also create new settings for each of the new segments.

### Example PIC24 (XC16)
As an example consider the memory map for **PIC24FJ256GB106**.

	/*
	** Memory Regions
	*/
	MEMORY
	{
	  data (a!xr) : ORIGIN = 0x800, LENGTH = 0x4000
	  reset : ORIGIN = 0x0, LENGTH = 0x4
	  ivt : ORIGIN = 0x4, LENGTH = 0xFC
	  _reserved : ORIGIN = 0x100, LENGTH = 0x4
	  aivt : ORIGIN = 0x104, LENGTH = 0xFC
	  program (xr) : ORIGIN = 0x200, LENGTH = 0x2A9F8
	  CONFIG3 : ORIGIN = 0x2ABFA, LENGTH = 0x2
	  CONFIG2 : ORIGIN = 0x2ABFC, LENGTH = 0x2
	  CONFIG1 : ORIGIN = 0x2ABFE, LENGTH = 0x2
	}

The Program Flash ranges from 0x00 to 0x2AC00 (on a PIC24 program memory is organized as words and each instruction is 24 bits wide), and contains the memory regions `reset`, `ivt`, `_reserved`, `aivt`, `program` and the config words. Next we need to find the segment to section mapping, i.e. if you look deeper you'll see that the sections [.reset, .init, .user_init, .handle, .isr, .libc, .libm, .libdsp, .lib, usercode, userconst] end up going into the program memory which we refer to as **TEXT** segment. Similarly the Data (ndata, data) and BSS (nbss, bss) needs to be mapped.

	  .reset :
	  {
	        SHORT(ABSOLUTE(__reset));
	        SHORT(0x04);
	        SHORT((ABSOLUTE(__reset) >> 16) & 0x7F);
	        SHORT(0);
	  } >reset
	
	  .text :
	  {
	        *(.init);
	        *(.user_init);
	        KEEP (*(.handle));
	        KEEP (*(.isr*));
	        *(.libc) *(.libm) *(.libdsp); /* keep together in this order */
	        *(.lib*);
	  } >program
	
	  usercode :
	  {
	        *(usercode);
	  } >program

The mapping can also be seen in the Map file:

	Program Memory  [Origin = 0x200, Length = 0x2a9f8]
	
	section                    address   length (PC units)   length (bytes) (dec)

	.const                      0x113a                0xb6           0x111  (273)
	.dinit                      0x11f0                0xde           0x14d  (333)

	.nbss                        0x808                   0             0x4  (4)

	.data                        0x812                   0            0xc4  (196)
	.bss                         0x8d6                   0             0x6  (6)
	.data                        0x8dc                   0             0x4  (4)
	.bss                         0x8e0                   0             0x2  (2)
	
	                        Total data memory used (bytes):           0xe2  (226) 1%
                        
I've specified the superset of the FT32 and PIC24 mapping as default attributes in `Settings.cs` so everything should work out of the box for FT32/PIC24. PIC32 has a more complicated map, so I haven't gotten around to that yet.

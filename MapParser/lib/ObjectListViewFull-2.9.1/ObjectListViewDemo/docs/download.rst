Downloads
=========

OK. Now that you're interested, how do you actually get the code?

NuGet Package
-------------

You can load ObjectListView via NuGet_. The package is named `ObjectListView.Official`.

.. _NuGet: http://www.nuget.org

This includes just `ObjectListView.dll`, not the demo, tests or other projects. For those addition resources, you should
download the SourceForge package below.

There are a couple of other ObjectListView packages but they are not managed by me. 

Stable releases
---------------

v2.9.0 released in July 2015 is the most recent stable release.

`Click here to download the full package`_, which includes the ObjectListView control, demos, documentation and unit tests (2.9 MB).

.. _Click here to download the full package: http://sourceforge.net/projects/objectlistview/files/objectlistview/2.9.0/ObjectListViewFull-2.9.0.zip/download

`Click here`_ to download just the source code of the ObjectListView project (740 KB).

.. _Click here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/objectlistview/files/objectlistview/2.8.0/ObjectListView-2.9.0.zip/download

`Click here to download a CHM`_ documentation file built from the source code (4.6 MB). This is a reference only and not particularly readable.

Not-so-stable releases
----------------------

There are currently no not-so-stable releases.

Bleeding-edge source
--------------------

If you are a very keen developer, you can access the SVN repository directly for this
project. The following SVN command will fetch the most recent version from the repository::

 svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/objectlistview/code/cs/trunk objectlistview-trunk

There are details on `how to use Subversion here <https://sourceforge.net/p/forge/documentation/svn/>`_ on SourceForge.

Please remember that code within the SVN is bleeding edge. It has not been well-tested and
is almost certainly full of bugs. If you just want to play with the ObjectListView, it's
better to stay with the official releases, where the bugs are (hopefully) less obvious.
